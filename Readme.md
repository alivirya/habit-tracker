# Habit Tracker Extension

This is just a project of mine as I'm disatisfied with the way I'm tracking my habits in Notion.

## Ideal Features

-   Ability to create new habit trackers
-   For habit data to be stored somewhere (local storage maybe? too much work to do it elsewhere)
-   For there to be a count of how long it's been since you've started the habit

## Nice to have

-   Ability to change background of extension
-   Ability to make notes on what I am doing to implement these habits

## Todos

-   Need to fix types
