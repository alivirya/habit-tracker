# Habit Tracker Extension

**Disclaimer: Not my best work - I've learnt when you do stuff in your free time that is limited that you want to use, you can get very hacky**

This is just a project of mine as I'm dissatisfied with the way I'm tracking my habits in Notion.

## Ideal Features

-   [x] Ability to create new habit trackers
-   [x] For habit data to be stored somewhere (local storage maybe? too much work to do it elsewhere)
-   [x] For there to be a count of how long it's been since you've started the habit
-   [ ] Refresh every week - need to check this one
-   [x] When you click on one of the habits, open a modal that makes it configurable
-   [ ] A way to have a list of backgrounds to iterate through
-   [ ] Have something for reminders as well?
-   [ ] Have a way that determines whether to have the count done by week/day? Also determine how many tick marks need to be done per week for the habit to be carried over

## Technical thoughts

-   A better way to update arrays? Not sure if there is something in typescript to make it infer - I think there is something that was done at work, should look at this
-   A better way to deal with dates? Ah improved a little bit but still kind of annoying

## Nice to have

-   Ability to make notes on what I am doing to implement these habits

## Todos

-   Need to fix types
